# Multivariate-Stock-Market-Analysis
Background information:The stock market prediction has been an active area of research for quite a while. However,building a model that takes into consideration every factor is still a challenging problem. Apartfrom historical prices, the current stock market is affected by social media, news articles andmany other microeconomic and macroeconomic factors. There are several models out there topredict the stocks based on social media or historical prices or news articles but none havetaken into consideration all three. In this project, we are building a network analysis model bytaking around 10 companies from every industry and then analyzing how much fluctuationhappens in one company due to a particular headline and how it affects the other companiesconnected to it.
