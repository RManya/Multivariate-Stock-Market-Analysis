# Multivariate-Stock-Market-Analysis
Project performed for the course IE7275- Data Mining in Engineering. 

The stock market prediction has been an active area of research for quite a while. However, building a model that takes into consideration every factor is still a challenging problem. Apart from historical prices, the current stock market is affected by news articles about the company, general news and many other micro economic and macroeconomic factors. There are several models out there to predict the stocks based on general news elements or historical prices but none have taken into consideration all company specific news or all of these factors together.

In this project, our goal is to analyse how much of a role do these factors play while attempting to predict the next day's stock price.Thus, making a model with checking all possible computations and permutations that improves it's accuracy and delivers an efficient model.
